## Liability for contents:

The contents of our pages have been created with the greatest care. However, we cannot assume any liability for the accuracy, completeness and up-to-dateness of the contents. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 Abs. 1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) in accordance with the general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored external information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general laws remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete infringement. If we become aware of any such violations of the law, we will remove these contents immediately.

## Liability for links:

Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal infringements at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. A permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is, however, unreasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. Upon becoming aware of any legal infringements, we will remove such links immediately.

## Copyright:

The content and works on these pages created by the site operator are subject to Croatian copyright law. The duplication, processing, distribution and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this website are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site has not been created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, the contents of third parties are marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. Upon becoming aware of any legal infringements, we will remove such contents immediately.

## Privacy:

The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (e. g. name, address or e-mail addresses) are collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.     
We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e. g. communication by e-mail) may be subject to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect the data from access by third parties.    
The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third parties for the purpose of sending unsolicited advertising and information material is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, e. g. by spam mails.

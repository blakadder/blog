Update WebView on T6E based multi-functional control panels running on Android 8.1 (NSPanel Pro and Tuya)

_Shopping links in this article are affiliate links and I earn a small commission when you buy through them_

This guide is tested on touch control panels such as:
- Sonoff NSPanel Pro ([ITEAD Store](https://itead.cc/product/sonoff-nspanel-pro-smart-home-control-panel/ref/34/)*)
- Moes T6E ([Moes.com](https://www.moeshouse.com/products/tuya-smart-home-multi-functional-touch-screen-control-panel-4-inch-in-wall?ref=v4thya2eufek)\*, [AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dee5hOB)\*)
- Aubess Ethernet Smart Control Panel ([AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DltEVer)*)


They're based on the same T6E PCB and firmware from Smatek. That firmware is based on Android 8.1 with an ancient version of WebView which prevents most of smart home dashboard applications from working (f.e. Fully Kiosk Browser, Wallpanel).

With gracious help from [tilaksidduram](https://twitter.com/tilaksidduram) I've compiled information on how to update WebView to newest version and run any app.

## Install ADB
Download the [Android platform-tools](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip) and unzip the contents to a folder. Open a Command Prompt and navigate to that folder. In my case it is located at `D:\adb`

Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder.

## ADB Access to Panel

### Wireless

Some panels might have ADB over TCP set up already (like NSPanel Pro) which saves you from disassembling it. 

Find out the IP address of your panel and try connecting to it with this command

`adb connect [panel_ip]`

If it responds with `connected to [panel_ip]:5555` you've connected to the panel and you're ready to proceed.

### USB

If wireless fails you have to disassemble the panel to gain access to the USB port labelled OTG

Remove the panel from the base. Unscrew the two screws on the back then carefully pry away the back plate starting at this point.

Now unscrew the tiny screws holding the PCB to the screen. Disconnect the touch panel connector to lift up the PCB enough to plug in a data USB cable.

Connect the data USB cable from your computer to the OTG port. If your device isn't recognised as adb, download [ADB drivers](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb) and install them.

## Install a Launcher

To make working with your panel easier you need to install a standard launcher. I've found the smallest launcher possible (only 7kb), which doesn't take up a lot of precious device memory.

Download the [Ultra Small Launcher](/assets/ultra-small-launcher.apk) to the ADB folder and install it with:

```sh
adb install ultra-small-launcher.apk
```

Simulate a Home key press. 

```sh
adb shell input keyevent 3
```

You will be offered a selection of launchers, set Launcher as default.


## Install Xposed

Download [Xposed Installer](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/rovo89/xposed-installer/xposed-installer-3-1-5-release/xposed-installer-3-1-5-android-apk-download/) and install it:

```sh
adb install de.robv.android.xposed.installer_3.1.5-43_minAPI15(nodpi)_apkmirror.com.apk
```

Download [Xposed Framework](https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=673956719939830416).

Unzip xposed-v90-sdk27-arm64-beta3.zip to a folder then archive the extracted files into a .tar file with f.e. [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html). 

[![Make a .tar archive with 7-Zip](/assets/images/android-panel-webview/7ziptar.jpg)](/assets/images/android-panel-webview/7ziptar.jpg)

Copy .tar file to ADB folder then upload it to the panel filesystem:

```sh
adb push xposed-v90-sdk27-arm64-beta3.tar /sdcard/Download/
```

Open shell in ADB

```sh
adb shell
```

Switch to root 

```sh
su
```

Make filesystem writeable

```sh
mount -o rw,remount /system
```

Navigate to the directory where you uploaded Xposed framework

```sh
cd /sdcard/Download/
```

Extract the xposed-v90-sdk27-arm64-beta3.tar file

```sh
tar -xvf xposed-v90-sdk27-arm64-beta3.tar
```

Change into the new directory
```sh
cd /sdcard/Download/xposed-v90-sdk27-arm64-beta3/
```

Make the installer script executable

```sh
chmod a+x /sdcard/Download/xposed-v90-sdk27-arm64-beta3/META-INF/com/google/android/flash-script.sh
```

Run Xposed framework installer script

```sh
sh /sdcard/Download/xposed-v90-sdk27-arm64-beta3/META-INF/com/google/android/flash-script.sh
```

Xposed Framework is now installed, but not activated. Reboot your device. It will take longer to boot than usual on the first boot.

Once the panel has rebooted use `adb shell input keyevent 3` to open the launcher again then open the Xposed app, gloss over the warning and make sure it is activated.

If it's orange and says itâ€™s not activated, another reboot might solve it

## Install AnyWebView

Download [AnyWebView](https://github.com/neoblackxt/AnyWebView/releases/) and install it. 

```sh
adb install AnyWebView.apk
```

Open Xposed again, open _Modules_ from the left menu and activate AnyWebView.

![Activate AnyWebView](/assets/images/android-panel-webview/anywebview.png)

Reboot your device.

## Update WebView

Now you need to install an updated WebView component. You can install [Android System WebView](https://apkpure.com/android-system-webview/com.google.android.webview/versions), [Bromite WebView](https://www.bromite.org/system_web_view) or any compatible webview.

Download an arm64 version in .apk form **NOT** Bundle or .xapk.

Install WebView

```sh
adb install "Android System WebView_v105.0.5195.136_apkpure.com.apk"
```

Wait a while because it's a large install.

Go to  **Settings -> System -> About tablet -> Build Number** and tap the "Build Number" option 7 times to enable developer options.

In **Developer options**, navigate to _WebView Implementation_ and choose your WebView instead of the outdated "Android System WebView 61.x"

## Finished

Now you can use Fully Kiosk, Home Assistant Companion or any other app that depends on a newer version of WebView.

## Introduction and first thoughts

I would like to commend the packaging the headphones came in. It is showcasing the product well even before the premium feeling unboxing experience. I'm always a sucker for an interesting unboxing instead of digging into some tape on a brown box.

The headphones are well designed with a minimal and sleek look. The rubbery material has a feeling of quality in your hands and feels comfortable on the head.

## Inclusions and pairing up

The headphones come with a charging cable, some ear plugs and instructions.

The setup process is as straightforward as it gets. The only thing necessary to pair the headphones with your phone is a Bluetooth connection.

## Sound clarity and usage

After thorough use over a couple of weeks, I was pleasantly surprised at the headphones audio quality. The mid tones and voices are clear and even. Despite having clear mid tones they are lacking in lower parts of the frequency spectrum. They dip into distorted territory at times and the bass doesn't have depth which is just due to the bone conducting technology used and not having traditional membranes. That didn't pose an issue during my typical use since I primarily used them for calls, audiobooks, podcasts and video watching in which they were stellar.

## Design and comfort

The ergonomic of the headphones were lacking. While their light frame kept my head from feeling too heavy, it did not feel as nice and comfortable nor as secure as normal headphones or earphones. The length of the frame isn't adjustable nor bendable so it will not fit all head sizes equally. In my case it kept falling off of my head, especially when walking on uneven surfaces or doing intensive activities.

Control buttons are push buttons which feel nice to use. They are very easy to find behind your ear and identifiable with the embossed "+" and "-".

## Battery life and charging time

Headphones are charged with a simple magnetic port located next to the controls. The battery lasts the full 8 hours (as advertised) which is a lot and beats most of the in-ear buds I've previously used. Charging time is a respectable cca 1 hour and 45 minutes which is a nice ratio.

## Conclusion and final thoughts

These headphones were not amazing but they're far from bad. They are intended for active users that enjoy sports and similar activities and are perfect for long walks while listening to podcasts or audiobooks. They're light and do not stress the ears after wearing them for hours and I've come to appreciate that aspect quite a lot and will probably cherish it even more when summer hits. The limitations that stem from the bone conducting technology cannot provide an amazing music listening experience as traditional head/earphones.
